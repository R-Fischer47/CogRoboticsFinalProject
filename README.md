# 6D Pose Estimation of Objects Using the GOOD descriptor

This repository is the work of Richard Fischer, Bharath Raj, Ruben Spolmink and Bharath Musaudhi Rajan for the course Cognitive Robotics (WMAI003-05.2020-2021.1A) at the University of Groningen.

In this projectwe  try  to  enhance  an  existing  object  recognizer  algorithm  withan additional feature of orientation validation. Our idea for thisimplementation  is  to  couple  a  voting-based  point  pair  feature(PPF) pose estimation algorithm (Drost et al. 2010) with a state ofthe art object descriptor - Global orthographic object descriptor(GOOD)  (Kasaei  et  al.  2016)
